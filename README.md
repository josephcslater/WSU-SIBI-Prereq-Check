# WSU-SIBI-Prereq-Check

## You need to:

- Please look at the prerequisites.xlsx file.
  - Each column header is the name of the course, each row below is a required prerequisite. If  prerequisites can be satisfied multiple ways, add more columns for the course (as per the example... which is a ficticious example).
  - You should likely name it EE_prerequisites.xlsx or such. Whatever you name it will have to be put into the notebook file.
  - This excel file will need to be in the same folder as the script to run for now.
- Create a transfer spreadsheet
    - This spreadsheet needs to be obtained directly from me as my baseline contains FERPA information
    - This spreadsheet allows you to note that you've agreed that a course requirement has been completed **for the sake of satisfying prerequisites**.
    - This is useful when considering transfer students whose transcripts have yet to post so that you avoid false warnings.
