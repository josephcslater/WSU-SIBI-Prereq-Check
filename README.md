# WSU-SIBI-Prereq-Check

Needs 4xxx is equivalent to 6xxx, and 3xxx equiv for 5xxx

Needs major checking all undergraduate courses for Non ME

Please look at the prerequisites.xlsx file.

Each column header is the name of the course, each row below is a required prerequisite. If  prerequisites can be satisfied multiple ways, add more columns for the course (as per the example... which is fictitious).

You should likely name it EE_prerequisites.xlsx or such. Whatever you name it will have to be put into the file 'prereq_config.py' which I just created to go along with it.

Make sure it can be found. There is a settings file, but I will move this to Jupyter to make things easier.

This excel file will need to be in the same folder as the script to run for now.
