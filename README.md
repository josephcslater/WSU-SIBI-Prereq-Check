# WSU-SIBI-Prereq-Check

## You need to:

1. Install the [github app](https://desktop.github.com/).
   - You don't need to make an account (anymore)
2. [Clone this repository](x-github-client://openRepo/https://github.com/josephcslater/WSU-SIBI-Prereq-Check) (Just click on [this link](x-github-client://openRepo/https://github.com/josephcslater/WSU-SIBI-Prereq-Check))
   - When it asks you where to put it, put it in your documents folder, or a reasonable subfolder **that you will remember**.
3. [Install Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
   - You should see a big green button under *Python 3.6 version*. Click it and agree to all of it.
4. Please look at the prerequisites.xlsx file.
   - Each column header is the name of the course, each row below is a required prerequisite. If  prerequisites can be satisfied multiple ways, add more columns for the course (as per the example... which is a ficticious example).
   - You should likely name it EE_prerequisites.xlsx or such. Whatever you name it will have to be put into the notebook file.
   - This excel file will need to be in the same folder as the script to run for now.
5.  Create a transfer spreadsheet
    - This spreadsheet needs to be obtained directly from me as my baseline contains FERPA information
    - This spreadsheet allows you to note that you've agreed that a course requirement has been completed **for the sake of satisfying prerequisites**.
    - This is useful when considering transfer students whose transcripts have yet to post so that you avoid false warnings.

This won't complete the process, I will have to:

- Install the package that you downloaded
- Run the notebook and configure to your settings
- Demonstrate how to use it.

However, doing all of the above will mean that we won't have to wait while I do the above things for you (or worse, we don't have the files ready and I have to come back later.).
